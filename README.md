### A repo to store the solutions of problems that I solved on various platforms.

### Update
17-Sept 2021 : Now, after nearly 11 months this repo has solutions of problems I solved in contests, questions I had practised on various sites. I made this effort to keep consistent towards coding. Now after all these things & that much time I have understood the importance of it & to keep consistent toward it.

## So, that's why I have decided to not continue further & focus on learning & practice diffcult questions. I have decided to do this to be consistemt & I have got this üòÑ

**WHY**

This is for self evaluation to make me accountable towards Competitive Coding

**GOAL**
- To be consistent daily and solved at least 1 problem on DSA.


You get this boii.. Let start and remember one thing :blush: :smiley:

#### *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever let someone tell you, you can‚Äôt do something. You got a dream, you got to protect it. People can‚Äôt do something themselves, they want to tell you you can‚Äôt do it. You want something, go get it. Period.‚Äù*
